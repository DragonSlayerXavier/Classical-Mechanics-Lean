# Classical-Mechanics-Lean

##Introduction 

This project attempts to formalize different classical mechanics formulations, namely, Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian models. We begin by formally defining the physical laws or 'axioms' governing mechanics in each of the aforementioned formulations. We then show that a solution to the equations of any of the above formulations will also satisfy the other equations.
